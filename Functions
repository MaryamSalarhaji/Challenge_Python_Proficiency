# The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
# The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
# The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
# This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years
# , while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.

# If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.
