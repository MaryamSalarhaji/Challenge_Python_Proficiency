#Challenge 10= 23 December 2024: Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:

# insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
# print: Print the list.
# remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
# append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
# sort: Sort the list.
# pop: Pop the last element from the list.
# reverse: Reverse the list.
# Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n
# lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above.
# Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

# Initialize the list
my_list = []

#  Reads an integer n from the user, representing the number of commands to process.
n = int(input("Enter the number of commands: ")) # prompts the user to enter data and converts the input string into an integer.

# Iterate over each command
# Loops exactly n times, once for each command. The variable _ is used
# as a placeholder since its value isn't used inside the loop.
for _ in range(n):

# Read the command and split it into parts
#Purpose: Reads a command string from the user and splits it into a list of strings.
# How it works:
# input() takes the full command as a string (e.g., "insert 0 5").
# .split() breaks the string into parts based on spaces (e.g., ["insert", "0", "5"]).
    command = input("Enter command: ").split()

# Extract the command name and arguments
#Purpose: Separates the command name (cmd) and its arguments (args).
# Details:
# cmd is the first element of the command list (e.g., "insert").
# args contains the rest of the list as arguments (e.g., ["0", "5"]).
    cmd = command[0]
    args = command[1:]

# Perform the corresponding operation
#Purpose: Inserts an element e at index i in my_list.

# map(int, args) converts arguments from strings to integers.
# my_list.insert(i, e) inserts e at index i.
    if cmd == "insert":
        i, e = map(int, args)
        my_list.insert(i, e)
    elif cmd == "print":
        print(my_list)
# Purpose: Removes the first occurrence of element e from my_list.

# int(args[0]) converts the argument to an integer.
# my_list.remove(e) removes the element.
    elif cmd == "remove":
        e = int(args[0])
        my_list.remove(e)
    elif cmd == "append":
        e = int(args[0])
        my_list.append(e)
    elif cmd == "sort":
        my_list.sort()
    elif cmd == "pop":
        my_list.pop()
    elif cmd == "reverse":
        my_list.reverse()
