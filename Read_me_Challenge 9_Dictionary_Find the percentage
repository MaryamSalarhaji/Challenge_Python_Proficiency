n = int(input())
Purpose: This line reads a single input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable n.
What it does: It represents the number of students for whom you will input marks.
Example: If the user enters 3, then n = 3. This means the program will expect details for 3 students.
2️⃣ student_marks = {}
Purpose: Initializes an empty dictionary called student_marks.
What it does: The dictionary will store student names as keys and their corresponding marks as values (as a list of numbers).
Example: Later, it could look like this:
python
Copy code
student_marks = {'Alice': [78.0, 85.0, 90.0], 'Bob': [88.0, 92.0, 79.0]}
3️⃣ for _ in range(n):
Purpose: Starts a loop that will run n times.
What it does: The variable _ is used as a "throwaway" variable since it's not being used within the loop. Each iteration collects input for one student.
Example: If n = 3, then the loop runs 3 times to collect input for 3 students.
4️⃣ name, *line = input().split()
Purpose: Reads a single line of input, splits it into separate parts, and assigns the first part to name and the rest of the parts to line.
How it works:
input() reads the entire line as a string (like "Alice 78 85 90").
.split() splits this string into parts: ['Alice', '78', '85', '90'].
The first part ('Alice') is assigned to name, and the remaining parts (['78', '85', '90']) are collected into line as a list.
Example: If the input is "Alice 78 85 90", then:
python
Copy code
name = 'Alice' 
line = ['78', '85', '90']
5️⃣ scores = list(map(float, line))
Purpose: Converts each of the values in line from strings to floating-point numbers and stores them in a list called scores.
How it works:
map(float, line) applies the float() function to each element in line, converting each of the elements like '78', '85', and '90' to 78.0, 85.0, and 90.0.
list() turns the result of map() into a list of floats.
Example:
python
Copy code
line = ['78', '85', '90']
scores = [78.0, 85.0, 90.0]
6️⃣ student_marks[name] = scores
Purpose: Adds a new entry to the student_marks dictionary, where the key is the student's name and the value is their list of scores.
What it does: This line creates a new key-value pair in the dictionary.
Example: If name = 'Alice' and scores = [78.0, 85.0, 90.0], then:
python
Copy code
student_marks['Alice'] = [78.0, 85.0, 90.0]
7️⃣ query_name = input()
Purpose: Reads the name of a student whose marks you want to query.
What it does: It stores the input (typically a student's name) in the variable query_name.
Example: If you input 'Alice', then:
python
Copy code
query_name = 'Alice'
Summary
Input n: Number of students.
Loop n times to input each student's name and scores.
Store the student name as a key and their list of scores as the value in student_marks.
Input the name of a student to query later.
Example Input

query_name = 'Bob'
