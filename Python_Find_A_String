#Challenge 16= 7 Jan, 2025: In this challenge, the user enters a string and a substring.
# You have to print the number of times that the substring occurs in the given string.
# String traversal will take place from left to right, not from right to left.
#NOTE: String letters are case-sensitive.

def count_substring(string, sub_string):
    count = 0
    start = 0
    while start < len(string):
        # Find the index of the next occurrence of the substring
        start = string.find(sub_string, start)

        # If the substring is found, increment the count
        if start != -1:
            count += 1
            # Move the starting position by one to allow overlapping matches
            start += 1
        else:
            break
    return count

# Input from user
string = input("Enter the main string: ")
substring = input("Enter the substring to search for: ")

# Count and print the occurrences of the substring
result = count_substring(string, substring)
print(f"The substring '{substring}' occurs {result} times in the given string.")
