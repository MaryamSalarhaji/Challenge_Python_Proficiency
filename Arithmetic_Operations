# Challenge_Day_2: 7_Dec_2024: Arithmetic Operations
# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:
# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
# The fourth line contains the result of integer division,  //
# The fifth line should contain the result of float division,  / .

num_1 = int(input("Please enter number_1: "))
num_2 = int(input("Please enter number_2: "))
sum = num_1 + num_2
difference = num_1 - num_2
mult = num_1 * num_2
div_int = num_1 // num_2
div_float = num_1 / num_2

print( "The sum is: ", sum)
print("The difference is:", difference)
print("The multiplication is: ", mult)
print("The integer division is:", div_int)
print("The float division is:", div_float)
