#Challenge 8: 17 Dec, 2024: Given the names and grades for each student in a class of N students,
# store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

#Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically
# and print each name on a new line.

#Step 1: Input the number of students and create the nested list
python_students=[]
for _ in range(int(input("Enter the number of students: "))):
        name = input("Enter the name of students with spaces: ")
        score = float(input("Enter the grade of the student: "))
        python_students.append([name, score])
#print(python_students)
# Step 2: Extract unique scores and sort them
scores = sorted({score for name, score in python_students})

# Step 3: Find the second lowest score
if len(scores) > 1:
    second_lowest_score = scores[1]
else:
    print("There is no second lowest score.")
    exit()

# Step 4: Find the names of students with the second lowest score
names_with_second_lowest_score = [name for name, score in python_students if score == second_lowest_score]

# Step 5: Sort the names alphabetically
names_with_second_lowest_score.sort()

# Step 6: Print each name on a new line
for name in names_with_second_lowest_score:
    print(name)
