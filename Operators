#Challenge 2: 11, Dec, 2024: Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip),
# and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal,
# find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.
# Function Description
# Complete the solve function in the editor below.
# solve has the following parameters:
# int meal_cost: the cost of food before tip and tax
# int tip_percent: the tip percentage
# int tax_percent: the tax percentage
# Returns The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.
def solve (meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent):
    tip = meal_cost * (tip_percent/100) #calculate tip according to the tip_percent, must divide by 100 for percentage
    tax = meal_cost * (tax_percent/100) #calculate tax according to the tax_percent, must divide by 100 for percentage
    total_cost = meal_cost + tip + tax
    result = round (total_cost) #round the result via built-in round function
    print (result) #print result in the proposed function
    return result

meal_cost = float (input("Enter meal cost: "). strip()) #ask for float number for meal cost, convert to float number, apply built-in strip function to avoid whitespace
tip_percent = int(input("Enter tip percentage: "). strip()) #ask for integer number for tip, convert to integer number
tax_percent = int(input("Enter tax percentage: "). strip()) #ask for integer number for tax, conver to integer number
solve (meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent) #called solve function
