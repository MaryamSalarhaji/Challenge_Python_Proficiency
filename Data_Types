# Challenge 1: 9, Dec, 2024: Data Types from Hacker Rank
# Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type float, and one of type string.
# Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below)
# and initialize your  variables.
# Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
# Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
# Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
# Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer that you must sum with i.
# The second line contains a double that you must sum with d.
# The third line contains a string that you must concatenate with s.
#Output Format
#Print the sum of both integers on the first line,
# the sum of both doubles (scaled to  decimal place) on the second line,
# and then the two concatenated strings on the third line.
i = 4
d = 4.0
s = "HackerRank "
#Declare second integer, float, and string variables.
integer = int(input("Please enter an integer number: "))
double_num = float(input("Please enter a decimal number: "))
string = input("Pleae enter words: ")
#print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
sum_int = i + integer
print("The sum of two integer is: ", sum_int)
#print the sum of float variables on a new line.
sum_float = d + double_num
print("The sum of float variables is: ", sum_float)
#concatenate and print the string variables on a new line.
sum_string = s + string
print("The concatenation of two string variable is: ", sum_string)
