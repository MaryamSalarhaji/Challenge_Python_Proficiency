#Challenge 20: 13, Jan, 2025: Given an integer,n , print the following values for each integer i from  1 to n:
# Decimal
# Octal
# Hexadecimal (capitalized)
# Binary

# Function Description
# Complete the print_formatted function in the editor below.
# print_formatted has the following parameters:
# int number: the maximum value to print

# Prints
# The four values must be printed on a single line in the order specified above for each  i from  1 to number.
# Each value should be space-padded to match the width of the binary value of number
# and the values should be separated by a single space.

#First Write a function for this task
def print_formatted(number):
#we must define width, because in the print description it is specified that each value should be space-padded to
#math the width of the binary value of the number.
    width = len(bin(number)[2:])
#loop because we must print decimal, octal, hexadecimal and binary for number from i to n
    for i in range(1, number+1):
    # for the decimal of number the string function is used
        deci = str(i)
    #for the octal of the number, the bult-in octal function is used,
    # we used the index from 2 to prevent writing of characters like zero and X
        octa = oct(i)[2:]
    #for hexadecimals used the bult-in hex function and said capitalized so use upper
        hexa = hex(i)[2:].upper()
    #for binary used the bult-in bin function
        bina = bin(i)[2:]
    #used rjust because of the space-padded
        print(deci.rjust(width), octa.rjust(width), hexa. rjust(width), bina.rjust(width))

try:
    n = int(input("Please enter an integer number: "))
    print_formatted(n)
except:
    print("You enter bad input! Try again!")
