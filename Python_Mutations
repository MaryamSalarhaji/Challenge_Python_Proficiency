# Challenge 14= 30 Dec, 2024: We have seen that lists are mutable (they can be changed), and tuples are immutable (they cannot be changed).
# Let's try to understand this with an example.
# You are given an immutable string, and you want to make changes to it.
 # Example
# >>> string = "abracadabra"
# You can access an index by:
# >>> print string[5]
# a
# What if you would like to assign a value?
 # >>> string[5] = 'k'
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
# How would you approach this?
# One solution is to convert the string to a list and then change the value.
# Example
# >>> string = "abracadabra"
# >>> l = list(string)
# >>> l[5] = 'k'
# >>> string = ''.join(l)
# >>> print string
# abrackdabra

def mutate_string(string, position, character):
    #convert string to list, so it can be mutate
    l = list(string)
    #substitute the charatacter in the position we want
    l[position] = character
    string = ''.join(l)
    return string

#ask the user for the string
s = input("Please Enter your string to mutatate it: ")
#ask for the position that we want to modify and convert it to an integer
i = int(input("Enter the position you want to change: "))
#ask the user for the character
c = input("Enter the character you want: ")
s_new = mutate_string(s, i, c)
print(s_new)
