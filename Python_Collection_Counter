#Challenge 15: 31 Dec, 2024: A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys,
# and their counts are stored as dictionary values.

# from collections import Counter
# my_list = [1,1,2,3,4,5,3,2,3,4,2,1,2,3]
# print(Counter(my_list))
# print(Counter(my_list).items())
# print(Counter(my_list).keys())
# print(Counter(my_list).values())

# Task
#Raghu  is a shoe shop owner. His shop has X number of shoes.
# He has a list containing the size of each shoe he has in his shop.
# There are N number of customers who are willing to pay xi amount of money only if they get the shoe of their desired size.
# Your task is to compute how much money  earned.
#
# Input Format
# The first line contains X, the number of shoes.
# The second line contains the space separated list of all the shoe sizes in the shop.
# The third line contains N, the number of customers.
# The next N lines contain the space separated values of the shoe size desired by the customer
# and xi, the price of the shoe.

from collections import Counter
#Ask the user for the number of shoes
X = int(input("Please Enter the number of shoes: "))
#Ask the user for the list of shoe size in the shop
shoe_size = input("Enter a list of shoe size separated by spaces: ")
#Convert the input string to a list of numbers using map
shoe_size_list = list(map(int, shoe_size.split()))
count_available_shoe_size = Counter(shoe_size_list)
#Ask for the number of customers
N = int(input("Please enter the number of customers: "))
#Initialize total earnings
earnings = 0
#Ask for the desired shoe size and the price, must enter N times
for _ in range(N):
    size, price = map(int, input("Enter the desired shoe size and price separated by a space: ").split())
    if count_available_shoe_size[size] > 0:  # Check if the desired size is in stock
        earnings += price  # Add price to earnings
        count_available_shoe_size[size] -= 1  # Reduce the count of the shoe size
    else:
        continue  # Skip if the size is not available
# Output the total earnings
print("Total earning is:", earnings)
