#Day 1: 4, Dec, 2024: Challenge 1: IF_Else Condition
#Challenge 1: If_Else Condition: Write Python program that satisfies this condition
#Given an integer,n , perform the following conditional actions:
#If n is odd, print Weird.
#If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird.
#If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird.
#If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird.

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

# Input: An integer n
#input is for capture input from the user
#int is to convert input to an integer number
#strip is for removing any whitespace (including spaces, tabs, and newline characters) from the input string.
n = int(input().strip())
# Conditional actions
if n % 2 != 0:  # Check if n is odd
    print("Weird")
elif 2 <= n <= 5:  # Check if n is even and in the range 2 to 5
    print("Not Weird")
elif 6 <= n <= 20:  # Check if n is even and in the range 6 to 20
    print("Weird")
elif n % 2 == 0 and n > 20:  # Check if n is even and greater than 20
    print("Not Weird")
